# Building Linkedin from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Redux) and Firebase https://fir-a3f6d.web.app/

This application (a Linkedin clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Redux), Firebase Authentication + Firestore. I have built the following pages within this application: Sign-in and Sign-up and the main dashboard where the posts are displayed. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook. Authentication is used on all pages along with an authentication listener to save the user in localstorage. When the user closes the browser, his/her login will be saved and upon visiting the applicaiton it will automatically log the user in again.

Don't forget to give it a star, it would be much appreciated!
